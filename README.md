# Data Analysis Projects for CV

This repository is a curated portfolio showcasing my analytical thinking, proficiency in tools like Python, Power BI or Tableau and ability to draw insights from various datasets.

Each folder contains a self-contained mini-project focused on a specific topic or technique, complete with code, and conclusions. These projects are designed to demonstrate key skills that are relevant for roles in data analysis, business intelligence, and related fields. All of the projects lack CSV datasets because the files were too large for the repositories. Instead, each project includes a link to the data source.
